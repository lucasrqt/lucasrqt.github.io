Since October 2024, I have been pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at IRISA/Inria within the [Taran research group](https://team.inria.fr/taran/), under the supervision of [Fernando Fernandes dos Santos](https://fernandofernandesantos.github.io/) and [Angeliki Kritikakou](https://sites.google.com/site/angelikikritikakou/).

I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from *Université de Rennes 1* in 2022, followed by a Master's in **Cybersecurity** with a specialization in **hardware security** from *Cyberschool, Université de Rennes* in 2024.

My Ph.D. research focuses on developing innovative and efficient methods to protect large machine learning models against hardware attacks and improving their resilience to radiation-induced transient faults.

## Additional Activities

I am also the co-founder and secretary of the [**Café!** association](https://asso-cafe.github.io), which serves Ph.D. students, post-docs, research engineers, and interns at the IRISA laboratory.

Aside my associative engagements, I like rowing, running, and playing the guitar.
